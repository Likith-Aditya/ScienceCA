          Democritus was a Greek Philosopher who lived during 470-380 B.C. He
          had interests in metaphysics,mathematics and astronomy. He came up
          with the idea of the ‘atom’ and named it ‘Atomos’ in 442 BC. He didn’t
          give any scientific proof to his idea of atom, the indivisible
          particle, but he is known worldwide for is discovery. Fun Fact: He is
          nicknamed as “The Laughing Philosopher”.

          Dalton was a scientist from the 19th century. It was in this century
          that the industrial revolution was taking place and people began to
          question existing scientific theories and try to explore for new ones.
          It was the year 1803, Dalton was pondering about atoms and the law of
          conservation. Then he got an idea in his mind. He thought of atoms as
          indivisible, solid and movable balls. He proposed that they combined
          in whole number ratios. He also proposed that all atoms of a single
          element are same in composition. This was enough for his questions but
          later it was proved wrong by J.J. Thomson.

          But Dalton’s model still was not enough. Soon JJ Thomson performed an
          experiment the Cathode Ray Experiment. (No space to explain but this
          led to discovery of electrons) This experiment found the electrons.
          Dalton’s model suggested that atoms was the smallest thing but
          electrons were 2000 times smaller. This proved Dalton wrong. Now
          Thomson set out to find a new atomic model. This model was known as
          the Plum-Pudding Model. Electrons set in some pudding like positive
          mass which was massless.

        <p id="subtitle">Rutherford’s Ideas</p>
        <br />
        <!-- And make it cheesy ! -->
        <p>
          JJ Thomson’s ideas were good for the time but many scientists still
          did not believe what he said. Then Rutherford who had previously
          worked with Thomson had decided to try a new experiment. So, around
          the time of 1908-1913, Rutherford performed the famous Alpha
          scattering experiment where some alpha particles (From a radioactive
          source in a lead box) were made to pass through a thin gold foil and
          were observed on a screen. Most of them did what Thomson’s model
          suggested, they passed through but some retraced their steps or were
          deflected. This was observed every time the experiment was repeated.
          This led Rutherford to believe that the atoms were mostly empty space
          as most particles passed through but he also said that since some of
          these atoms were deflected more than 90 degrees through there must be
          a dense central body in the centre which must be positive (Alpha
          particles are positive). Since Protons were discovered by now,
          Rutherford proclaimed that the centre of atoms (Or Nucleus) was made
          up of protons. Later, Chadwick found neutrons in the nucleus and that
          was how the nucleus was discovered. This model included a nucleus with
          electrons just sitting around an atom (Will soon be proved wrong…).

        <p>
          Niels Bohr was a scientist who came after Rutherford. He added some
          more points to the Rutherford’s atomic model as it wasn’t widely
          accepted. He used existing theories like protons and nucleus along
          with his own neutron discovery to create a model. In his model, Atoms
          was a mass with empty space and a nucleus in the centre. There were
          shells around these atoms and they were called orbits. They were
          denoted as K, L, M, N. This Model is still widely used as it is the
          simplest and near accurate model we have. He said that electrons were
          easy to locate but that wasn’t that true after all.

        <p>
          There was a new theory again but this time it changed particles as we
          knew it including the atom. This theory was so radical that it took
          many years to even understand it partially. It is the most accurate
          yet unknown field of science. In this magical world of tiny particles
          where nothing is certain and everything has a wave function, The
          atomic model was fated to change. This happened in 1926 when
          Schrödinger a great scientist (who would be remembered for his Cat
          Thought Experiment) proposed a new theory for the atom. He used many
          Quantum principles of the time including superposition and
          Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle to come up with a model. This was
          different from Niels’ Bohr Model as it defined these atoms as 3D
          ellipses which was new. All the electrons where just probability waves
          with a higher probability near the nucleus. This model became a part
          of the Quantum Physics. This is the most accurate yet mysterious form
          of the atom and for simplicity’s sake it is usually the Bohr model
          which is used in schools today (Along with the concept of Sub-shells
          which Bohr did not explain).

          Side Quests: Nagaoka opposed JJ Thomson and proclaimed that atoms were
          like solar systems.Goldstein discovered Atoms using a reverse
          CRE.There were many other scientists going behind this big but tiny
          mystery of reality.
